# ChemicalReactivityPrediction
SDK for prediction of chemical reactivity using deep learning


### Roadmap for second milestome 
* [ ] Module which converts reaction in SMARTS format to suitable graph features: adjacency matrix, 
node and edge types, atom mapping and some features 
* [ ] Node classifier which define atoms of main products  

* [ ] Encoder-decoder graph model to predict changes in adjacency matrix

* [ ] Encoder-decoder graph model to predict main product

* [ ] Deployment the model to web server, analyzing errors 

* [ ] Adding result to the paper
